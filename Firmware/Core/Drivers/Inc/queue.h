/**
 * The Queue class is used to speed up flooding of the maze. It is very
 * simple and so not very flexible but shouldbe enough for the flooding.
 *
 * On a larger processor, you might create a Queue of operations that
 * constitute the required moves in a fast run. there is not much room on
 * the Arduino Nano.
 *
 * In the code, queues are created dynamically on the stack so you should
 * have some confidence that there is always enough space. Do not create
 * large queues if there in any doubt. The results can be unpredictable and
 * without obvious warnings. The default size is 64 elements. It is not clear
 * what the minimum queue size should be to guarantee no errors.
 *
 * By only using queues as local variables in this way, there can be no memory
 * leaks or heap fragmentation.
 *
 * To define a Queue of 64 bytes use something like:
 *    Queue<uint8_t> q_bytes;
 *
 * To define a Queue of 100 integers use something like:
 *    Queue<int,100> g_ints;
