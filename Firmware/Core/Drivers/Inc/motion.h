/***
 *
 * The motion class handles all the higher level Locomotion tasks. It is responsible
 * for converting instructions from a path planner into actual movement of the
 * robot.
 *
 * Motion control needs to know about the dynamics and kinematics of the robot
 * and may need environmental data as well. In particular, the battery voltage and
 * characteristics of the motors will be important.
 *
 * The output from the motion controller should be suitable control signals for
 * the actuators that make the robot move. In UKMARSBOT, that will simply be
 * voltages for each of the two drive motors. Other robots may have more motors,
 * an independent steering system or other kinds of effectors such as grippers or
 * weapons. Remember that the motors may be stepper motors which will need a
 * slightly modified approach.
 *
 * Here, the motion control makes use of simple trapezoidal profiles to calculate
 * continuously varying speeds for linear and rotary motion components.
 *
 * How these speeds are converted into individual control signals for the drive
 * system is the job of the Motors class. Thus is should be relatively easy to
 * change that class to suit different drive systems.
 *
 * TODO: Motion should have be given the profilers
 * TODO: should it also be given the motors?

   * Performs a turn. Regardless of whether the robot is moving or not
   *
   * The function is given three parameters
   *
   *  - angle  : positive is a left turn (deg)
   *  - omega  : angular velocity of middle phase (deg/s)
   *  - alpha  : angular acceleration of in/out phases (deg/s/s)
   *
   * If the robot is moving forward, it will execute a smooth, integrated
   * turn. The turn will only be repeatable if it is always performed at the
   * same forward speed.
   *
   * If the robot is stationary, it will execute an in-place spin turn.
   *
   * The parameter alpha will indirectly determine the turn radius. During
   * the accelerating phase, the angular velocity, will increase until it
   * reaches the value omega.
   * The minimum radius during the constant phase is
   *   radius = (speed/omega) * (180/PI)
   * The effective radius will be larger because it takes some time
   * for the rotation to accelerate and decelerate. The parameter alpha
   * controls that.
   *
   * Note that a real mouse may behave slightly different for left and
   * right turns and so the parameters for, say, a 90 degree left turn
   * may be slightly different to those for a 90 degree right turn.
