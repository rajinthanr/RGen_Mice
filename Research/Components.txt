MCU
    *stm32f405
        +have enough pins and speed for our micromouse
        -no builtin Wireless debugging options available
        +reliable
        IDE -> stm32CubeIDE

    esp32s3
        -pins are limited
        +builtin BT&WiFi available for debugging
        IDE -> esp-idf & ArduinoIDE

IR
    Emitter
        *SFH4545  (Half angle = 5°)
    Recievers
        TPS601A  (Angle of Half Sensitivity= ±10°) - many japanese mice used this one but it's been discontinued now
        LTR4206E (Angle of Half Sensitivity= ±20°)
        *TEFT4300 (Angle of Half Sensitivity= ±30°) - commonly used one

IMU
    LY3200ALH (Analog Gyro - Single Axis - Rate noise density 0.074 dps/√Hz) - too old, noisy
    (+)ICM-20948 (9-Axis) - good one
    *(+)ICM-42688 - latest (32kHz DRO, low noise)
    ICM-45686
    ADXRS642
    ADXRS300 and ADXRS610
    (+)ASM330LHH (2020 by ST Microelectronics) - 3kHz sampling rate & reliable

Motor Driver
    TC4427 (Mosfet Driver) - need of p-mos means lack of efficency
    zxmhc3f381n8tc (3A Mosfet H-Bridge) - high current rating but bit harder to use
    *DRV8833 (1.5A) - easy to use and compact
    TB67H420FTG (9.0A) - overkill for our mouse and too many pins to solder

Motors
    N20 geared Motors with magnetic encoders
        +Builtin encoders
        +cheaper
        -not accurate
        -not small enough

    Faulhaber
        +Builtin encoders
        -too expensive
        +much accurate
        +Reliable
    
    Steppers
        -Too bulky and power hungry
        -too slow for micromouse
        +Higer Accuracy

    *Coreless Motor 1215 with quadrature magnetic encoders
        +Builtin encoders
        +cheaper
        +smaller
        -not reliable (but enough for our purpose)

Encoders
    It's better to use builtin encoders

Display
    HCMS-2903 - speed and compact but no of characters are limited, expensive
    *SSD1306 (0.96" OLED) - very slow, cheap
    SSD1306 (0.91" OLED) - this is also enough and compact

Power ICs
    *TPS76850 (5V 1A) - low dropout (230mV)
    *TPS73633 (3V3 400mA) - low dropout (76mV)
    AMS1117 (3V3 800mA) - Dropout voltage is high (1V)
